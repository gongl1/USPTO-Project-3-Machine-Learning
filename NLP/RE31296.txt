The embodiment of the invention in which I claim an exclusive property or privilege are defined as follows: .[..[.1. In an interengageable jaw clutch system the combination comprising:
.Iadd..[..[. A system according to claim 8, wherein the drive teeth and clutch teeth as formed on the jaw clutch portions project radially relative to said axis but project in opposite direction, said drive teeth and clutch teeth intermeshing with one another when said jaw clutch portions are engaged with one another, and wherein said blocking portions comprise toothlike members which also project radially relative to said axis, said toothlike members projecting in a direction opposite to said drive teeth..]..]..Iaddend. .Badd.10. In an interengageable jaw clutch system, the combination comprising:
a rotatable shaft and a first jaw clutch portion mounted thereon for axial sliding movement relative to said shaft and positive rotation therewith about an axis, said first jaw clutch portion defining a plurality of radially outwardly extending external drive teeth thereon;
a gear coaxially related to said shaft and a second jaw clutch portion fixed to said gear, said second jaw clutch portion defining a plurality of radially inwardly extending internal drive teeth thereon for interengagement with said external drive teeth of first jaw clutch portion upon relative axial movement of said jaw clutch portions toward one another; said first jaw clutch portion drive teeth at a radius suitable for engaging with drive teeth on said second jaw clutch portion, said drive teeth having leading edges for engagement with the clutch teeth of the other jaw clutch portion and defining the effective drive portions of said drive teeth, said first jaw clutch portion having also blocking teeth, said blocking teeth having leading portions generally axially aligned with the effective drive portions of said external drive teeth and trailing portions generally axially offset the effective drive portions of said external drive teeth, said trailing portions extending radially beyond the outer radial surfaces of said leading portions;
means to selectively axially move said gear relative to said shaft from a first position wherein said second clutch member is axially spaced from said first clutch member to a second position for engagement of said clutch members;
means resiliently biasing said first clutch portion toward said second portion and a stop member limiting axial movement of said first clutch portion to a position axially spaced from said second clutch portion when said gear is in said first position;
blocker means coacting between said first and second jaw clutch portions for positively preventing engagement of said jaw clutch portions so long as a substantial difference in relative speed exists therebetween, said blocker means including an annular blocker having blocking portions arranged on and supported by said drive teeth for limited rotation with respect thereto and positioned axially between the trailing portion of said blocking teeth and said clutch teeth when said jaw clutch portions are disengaged, one of said trailing portions of said blocking teeth and said blocking portion defining an array of spaces in cross section, said spaces capable of receiving therein the other of said trailing portions of said blocking teeth and said blocking portions when said spaces and said other of said trailing portions and said blocking portions are aligned to permit said blocking portions to relatively move axially past said trailing portions of said blocking teeth so that said jaw clutch portions can be engaged with one another; and
a surface on said blocker frictionally cooperating with a surface on said second jaw clutch portion for causing said blocker to tend to rotate relative to said first jaw clutch portion to the extent permitted by said drive teeth wherever and for so long as a substantial difference in relative rotative speeds exist between said respective jaw clutch portions, said blocking portions interferring with said trailing portions of said blocking teeth when said blocker is rotated relative to said first jaw clutch portion to the extent permitted by said drive teeth so as to prevent engagement of said jaw clutch portions. .Baddend. .Badd.11. A system according to claim 10 wherein said means for resiliently biasing said first jaw clutch portion is a compressed coil spring generally coaxial with said shaft. .Baddend. .Badd.12. A system according to claims 10 or 11 wherein said blocker is axially movable with said gear with a degree of axial freedom. .Baddend.
