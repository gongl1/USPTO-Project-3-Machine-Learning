We claim:
1. A two-armed transfer robot comprising:
a first double-pantograph mechanism and a second double-pantograph mechanism, each double-pantograph mechanism including a first pantograph assembly and a second pantograph assembly, the first pantograph assembly having an inner link, a pair of first intermediate links and an outer link associated with the inner link via the first intermediate links, the second pantograph assembly including the outer link in common with the first pantograph assembly, a pair of second intermediate links and a hand-supporting link associated with the outer link via the second intermediate links, the inner link being common to the first and the second double-pantograph mechanisms;
rotation-transmitting mechanisms provided between the first and the second intermediate links of the respective double-pantograph mechanism;
first and second handling members supported by the hand-supporting links of the first and the second double-pantograph mechanisms, respectively;
a stationary base member;
first to third shafts coaxially rotatable about a first axis extending vertically; and
first to third driving devices for actuating the first to the third shafts, respectively, the driving devices being fixed to the base member;
wherein one of the first intermediate links of the first double-pantograph mechanism is fixed to the first shaft for rotation about the first axis, one of the first intermediate links of the second double-pantograph mechanism being fixed to the second shaft for rotation about the first axis, the inner link being fixed to the third shaft for rotation about the first axis, the outer first intermediate links of the respective double-pantograph mechanisms being supported by the inner link for rotation about a common second axis, the first intermediate links and second intermediate links of each double-pantograph mechanism being equal in length, the second pantograph assembly of each double-pantograph mechanism being offset away from the first axis with respect to the first pantograph assembly of said each double-pantograph mechanism, the first and the second handling members being vertically spaced from each other, the handling members being arranged not only to linearly move in horizontal lines passing through the first axis but to rotate simultaneously around the first axis.
2. The transfer robot according to claim 1, wherein the second intermediate links of the respective double-pantograph mechanisms are arranged in a common plane.
3. The transfer robot according to claim 1, wherein the hand-supporting link of one double-pantograph mechanism is attached to an upper surface of each second intermediate link of said one double-pantograph mechanism, while the hand-supporting link of the other double-pantograph mechanism is attached to a lower surface of each second intermediate link of said other double-pantograph mechanism.
4. The transfer robot according to claim 1, wherein the first double-pantograph mechanism includes a third handling member attached to the hand-supporting link of the first double-pantograph mechanism, the third handling member projecting opposite to the first handling member, while the second double-pantograph mechanism includes a fourth handling member attached to the hand-supporting link of the second double-pantograph mechanism, the fourth handling member projecting opposite to the second handling member.
5. The transfer robot according to claim 1, wherein each of the first to the third shafts are rotatably supported via a magnetic fluid seal for hermetic sealing.
